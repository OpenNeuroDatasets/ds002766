This experiment has 3 subjects. Subjects wore a cast covering the entire
right upper extremity for two weeks and participated in daily MRI scans.

Two types of functional data were collected:
- A movement task, used to define regions of interest in the somatomotor system
- Daily 30-minute resting-state scans
