This experiment involved 3 participants. Participants wore a cast covering the entire right upper extremity for two weeks and underwent daily MRI scans.

Functional data included a movement task, used to define regions of interest in the somatomotor system, and daily 30-minute resting-state scans.

Two participants were also studied in a previous experiment, the Midnight Scan Club (MSC) experiment (https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000224). sub-cast1 = sub-MSC02; sub-cast2 = sub-MSC06
