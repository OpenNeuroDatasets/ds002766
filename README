Details of this dataset are described in Newbold et al., Plasticity and Spontaneous Activity Pulses in Disused Human Brain Circuits, Neuron (2020), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2020.05.007. This manuscript should be cited whenever publishing work using this dataset.

Three healthy adult participants wore a cast covering the entire right upper extremity for two weeks. They were scanned every day for 6-9 weeks. Scans included 42-64 daily 30-minute resting-state functional MRI scans before, during and after casting. Participants later underwent additional scanning as part of a control experiment. In all, we collected 27-43 hours of resting-state functional MRI data in each individual.

Participants also performed a block-design movement task (right hand, left hand, right foot, left foot, tongue) for 8 minutes each night prior to casting.

Sessions are grouped into 5 conditions. 3 conditions (pre, cast, post) correspond to the original experiment. 2 conditions (on, off) correspond to a control experiment in which participants wore a removable cast during scanning (on sessions) but were not casted during daily life.

Two participants were also studied in a previous experiment, the Midnight Scan Club (MSC) experiment (Gordon et al, 2017, https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000224). sub-cast1 = sub-MSC02; sub-cast2 = sub-MSC06. We applied many of the methods from the MSC experiment in the current study.

MSC participants were scanned using a 3T Siemens Trio MRI scanner.  BOLD data were acquired at a spatial resolution of 4mm, single-band, with a TR of 2.2s. We used identical sequences for sub-cast1 during the original cast experiment (but not during the later control experiment).

sub-cast2 and sub-cast3 were scanned on a 3T Siemens Prisma MRI scanner using updated sequences. The updated scanner and sequences were also appleid to sub-cast1 during the control experiment. BOLD data for these scans were acquired at a spatial resolution 2.4mm, multi-band 4, with a TR of 1.1s.

Surface parcellations for sub-cast3 were created using methods described by Gordon et al (2017). Corresponding parcellations for sub-cast1 and sub-cast2 can be found in the MSC dataset (https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000224): derivatives > surface_pipeline > {subject} > surface_parcellation.

Surface projection files for sub-cast1 can be found in the MSC dataset (https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000224): derivatives > surface_pipeline > sub-MSC02 > fs_LR_Talairach.
